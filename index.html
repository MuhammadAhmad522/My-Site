            <p class="bio">
                You could say that I am just a computer lover. I was about 5 years old when I started using computers. I
                did a lot of gaming in the early days. I was always curious about how things worked internally. I always
                wanted to explore more about computers. And now here I am discovering new things daily as I study more.
                Currently, I am geared towards Cybersecurity. I am also intersted in Cloud
                Infrastructure and Quantum Computing. </p>

                <h3>Web Development</h3>
                <p>
                    I am a web developer with expertise in designing and developing responsive and user-friendly
                    websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My skills also include proficiency in popular
                    frameworks such as React and Node. I am committed to staying up-to-date with the latest
                    web technologies and trends to create innovative and engaging web solutions for clients.</p>

                <h3>Penetration Testing</h3>
                <p>
                    As a penetration tester, my expertise lies in identifying vulnerabilities in computer systems and
                    networks by simulating attacks from malicious actors. I utilize various tools and techniques to
                    assess the security posture of an organization's digital infrastructure and provide recommendations
                    to improve their overall security posture.</p>

                <h3>Networking</h3>
                <p>
                    I'm really good at making sure computer networks are safe from bad people. I create and set up secure networks,
                    stop any attacks on them, and make sure everything follows the rules. I know a lot about how networks work and 
                    use the right tools to keep your information safe and available when you need it..
