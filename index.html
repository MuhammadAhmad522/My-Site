            <p class="bio">
            I am a passionate computer enthusiast on a mission to explore the realms of science and technology. My journey began at the age of five, where I initially engaged with computers through gaming. This early exposure ignited my curiosity for the inner workings of these machines, fostering a desire for continuous exploration and learning.

Today, I am committed to expanding my knowledge in the realm of computer science, with a primary focus on Cybersecurity. Additionally, I hold a keen interest in Cloud Infrastructure and Quantum Computing, further reflecting my dedication to staying at the forefront of technological advancements.

                <h3>Web Development</h3>
                <p>
                    I'm a web developer, and I create websites that work well on all devices. I use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which are like the building blocks of the web. I also know some cool tools called React and Node. I always keep learning about new stuff on the web to make websites that look great and do cool things for people.

                <h3>Penetration Testing</h3>
                <p>
                    I'm like a computer detective! I find weak points in computer systems and networks by pretending to be a bad guy. I use different tools and tricks to check how safe a company's digital stuff is. Then, I give them ideas on how to make everything more secure.

                <h3>Networking</h3>
                <p>
                    I'm really good at making sure computer networks are safe from bad people. I create and set up secure networks,
                    stop any attacks on them, and make sure everything follows the rules. I know a lot about how networks work and 
                    use the right tools to keep your information safe and available when you need it..
